# Auto_Vigilance_System
    This is my CDAC project.
The "AutoWatch Vigilance" project is an embedded system designed to enhance the security of 
automobiles by providing advanced theft detection and 
prevention capabilities. The project leverages the power 
of embedded systems, specifically utilizing an ESP32 
microcontroller and different communication protocol,
 to monitor and safeguard vehicles against unauthorized 
 access and theft.

 Component used in this project: 
•	ESP32 Microcontroller
•	SIM800L
•	DC MOTOR AND L298N Motor Driver
•	ADXL345 ACCELEROMETER
•	OLED DISPLAY 1.3”
•	DOOR SENSOR
